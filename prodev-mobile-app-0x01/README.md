## Get started

- Navigate to Your Project Directory
```bash
cd prodev-mobile-setup
```

- Initialize a new Expo project
```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest prodev-mobile-app-0x01
```

- Start the app
```bash
npx expo start
```

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
