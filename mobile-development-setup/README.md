## Mobile Development Environment Setup
### Objective
The goal of this task is to set up a mobile development environment using Expo Framework for React Native. Expo simplifies mobile app development by providing tools that allow developers to test and run applications seamlessly on physical devices without relying heavily on emulators.

### Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure the following are installed on your system:

- Node.js (LTS version)
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- macOS, Linux, or Windows OS
- A physical mobile device (Android or iOS)

### Why Expo Go?
Traditional mobile development often requires powerful machines to run emulators for different devices and operating systems. Expo Go provides a cost-effective solution by enabling developers to:

- Test apps directly on physical devices.
- Support both Android and iOS seamlessly.
- Avoid the complexity of managing multiple emulators.

### Installation Steps for Expo Go
- Visit the official Expo Go homepage: https://expo.dev/go
- Choose the latest SDK version.
- Install Expo Go on your device:
    Android: Google Play Store
    iOS: Apple App Store
- Open the Expo Go app on your device.

### Verification
After installation, you can verify your setup by:

- Opening the Expo Go app on your device.
- Scanning a QR code from a running Expo project (to be set up in later tasks).
- Confirming that the sample app loads successfully.
